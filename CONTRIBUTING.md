### Where to start
If you wish to start contributing to `borgor` the best place to begin is the [issues](https://github.com/hrszpuk/BorgorClient/issues) tab!
Issues are our way to keeping track of what needs to be done.
Our issues are crafted specially with new contributors in mind.
Near the title of each issue will be a series of labels, these give you much needed information about what the issue is about.
For example, if an issue has the `Bug` label, it means the issue is about fixing an issue in the source code.
For new contributors, like yourself, you will want to look out for the **Good first issue** and **Help wanted** labels.
These labels indicate new contributors are welcome to help or even take on the issue alone if they feel confident enough.

## Creating issues
Issues are how we keep track of what needs to be done, why it needs to be done, and when it needs to be done by.
When creating an issue, you need to conform to the issue templates provided.
There are two templates: feature requests, and bug reports.
Please choose the appropriate template for the issue you are submitting, you should add labels to your issues that give additional information to what the issue is about.
For example, an issue about multiple grammatical mistakes in documentation should be given the **Documentation** label.

## Creating pull requests
Pull requests are used for submitting pre-approved changes to the repository.
This means you are expected to create an issue, have the issue you create approved, then feature branch and create a pull request.
As with issues, please follow the pull request template provided and label your pull request appropriately.
You are expected to link back to previous issues related to the pull request. 

## Code quality

### Code readability
All code should be easy to understand, and make sense.
Please make use of decomposition; please break down functionality into multiple functions/blocks of code.
Functions containing thousands of lines of code are not appreciated without a good reason.
Code comments should also be consistent, detailed, and numerous but not overwhelming.

### Commit messages
Commit messages should be a consistent length, with both a brief summary message with a more detailed description.
